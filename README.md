we will go over the steps of Data Pre-Processing:
****

1. **Data  Cleaning**: 
 The cleaning function removes all noises to delivers smooth Arabic text without impacting its meaning or content, such as:
    - Extra characters 
    - Emojis
    - Non-Arabic characters
    - URLs
    - Any Punctuations 
****
2. **Data Normalization**: While data cleaning was used, we normalized the Egyptian text by:
    - Remove elongation which is repeated letters.
    - Correct the text by checking the spelling of Arabic sentences.
    - Remove Tashkeel of the characters.
**** 
3. **Data Visulaization**: Visualize the text data using Arabic word cloud
